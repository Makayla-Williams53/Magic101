## Project for Advanced Java

This was my first assignment in my high school Advanced Java class in August of 2022. It was a project that the
specifications were determined by me and my classmates, that incorporated the use of parent and child classes.
We chose to have the parent class be wizard, whilst the child classes were three specific types of wizards and 
one dragon.

Requirements:
1) Parent class with general attributes, constructor, and getters/setters
2) 4 child classes with unique attributes, construcotrs, getters/setters, brain methods
3) Creating objects for each of the parent and child classes with output
